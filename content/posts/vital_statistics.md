title: Vital Statistics

Keeping your vital information safe has become more important than ever in this age of data security and privacy infringement. Some vital info is automatic for people to remember: date of birth, social security number, height and weight. For businesses, a vital statistic that all too few principals and CFOs know is the Experience Rating Modification Factor, more commonly referred to as the EMR or the “mod”.

For most businesses, the cost of employees is the largest continuing expense. In addition to salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, and the cost of hiring, firing and training, employee expense includes Worker’s Compensation coverage. Workers Comp is statutory/mandatory insurance in most States. Rates and benefits vary by State and by classification of job duties. The mod adjusts the overall cost of worker’s Comp based on each company’s claims experience.

The basics about the mod:

Very simply, new businesses begin fresh with a 1.0 mod. Each year, the mod is calculated by comparing the Workers Comp premiums paid by the business against the incurred losses paid by the insurance company for injured employees. The “incurred losses” includes medical payments, indemnity payments to the employee for lost wages, insurance carrier expenses for adjusting and investigating the claims, and loss reserves. Reserves are established by the insurance carrier for open claims and reflect the best projected estimate of the total loss for an injury. This comparison is captured on a rolling 3-year basis.

Essentially, when premiums paid exceed incurred losses, the mod goes down below 1.0. If losses are higher than premium paid, the mod goes up above 1.0. The mod therefore separates one company’s profitability from another, rewarding good experience and penalizing poor experience. Beyond the mod, insurance carriers have some flexibility (based on their policy filings in each State) to apply additional premium debits, credits, and discounts. The mod often impacts customers, making the attractive ones eligible for credits or dividends.

A high mod can add insult to injury by piling on debits. The mod can also impact the balance of your business insurance portfolio. Got a .75 mod? Carriers will tend to compete for your complete portfolio. Got a 1.5 mod? The insurance road ahead is long and expensive.

What’s your mod? What’s your company’s mod? How has the mod trended over the past 5 years? If you don’t have the answer on the tip of your tongue, you are missing a vital statistic.

The mod is an indicator that will drive several decisions including risk management practices, insurance carrier selection, HR policies and procedures, employee training and retention, insurance broker selection and expense budgeting.
