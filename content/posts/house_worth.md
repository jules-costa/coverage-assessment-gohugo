title: What's Your House Worth?
+++
Your dwelling is often the largest investment and ongoing expense. Protecting your investment in the home is a primary objective and requires Coverage Assessment.

Let’s start with a quick quiz:

The correct insurance limit for your dwelling is:
A) whatever my bank/lender requires
B) the cost to replace the structure with like kind and quality materials
C) the amount I want to receive if I have a total loss
D) as little as possible to keep my premium low

While all of the choices have some merit, the key to proper valuation and coverage on your property is answer B.

Clients commonly misunderstand property valuation. Here are some very typical client misconceptions and their clarifications:

*“You want me to pay for $500,000 of insurance coverage on my dwelling but I couldn’t sell it for $250,000?!″*

This is the most common debate because homeowners translate “what’s my house worth?” with market value. Insurance contracts are only interested in the cost of construction to repair/restore/rebuild. We can insure the building in a variety of ways.

The most common, Replacement Cost, will repair or replace damage from a covered loss with like kind and quality materials, up to the limit of insurance. The calculation of the coverage limit is based on the building’s:

— Construction (Frame, Masonry, Non-Combustible, Fire Resistive)
— Occupancy (apartment, condo, single-family, multi-family)
— Protection (protection class is established based on distance to a fire station/hydrant)
— Exposure (square footage)
— Location/territory
— Age, amenities, special features

Insurance carriers use Replacement Cost Estimators that calculate the limit of insurance based on these parameters and amenities in the home. It is essential that you take time to work through a detailed estimator to arrive at the most accurate Replacement Cost for your home.

*“I don’t want to pay for $500,000 in coverage for my building. I’ll never have a total loss. This is a brick/stone/steel building and won’t burn to the ground.”*

Property policies can include a Co-Insurance Clause. 80% or 90% co-insurance are typical. Here’s the deal: you insure the building to value – we’ll cover the loss at replacement cost. You insure less than the value (and pay premium based on the lower limit of insurance) – we’ll impose a co-insurance penalty and only pay 80% or 90% of the actual loss.

Underinsuring the dwelling is the most common cause of homeowner dissatisfaction after a loss. I have repeatedly seen underinsured dwellings in assessing property policies, simply because the coverage limit renews as expiring year after year. Take a look a your current policy and you might be shocked at how low the Dwelling limit really is.

*“I don’t want to pay for $500,000 in coverage for my building. If this thing burns down, I wouldn’t replace it.”*

Alternative coverage is available, though much less common. Discuss a Functional Replacement Cost option or Actual Cash Value (ACV) option with your broker. ACV is considered a “last resort” coverage as it only pays based on the depreciated value of the building.

*“What’s the most I can insure my building for?”*

While rare, this customer question is a bit scary. It usually indicates that the home has some special features or is highly leveraged with a lender. Time to have a deeper conversation with your broker. Assess your homeowner’s insurance annually, especially if there have been major changes or renovations. Having the proper limit of insurance is your first and most important decision on any property policy.
