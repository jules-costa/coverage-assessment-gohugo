Every business faces sudden and accidental risks. It's not a question of whether the risk exists, but of magnitude. The local delivery truck for a family operated deli can cause the same potential injury or damage to others as the regional food distributor with a fleet of 300 vehicles. Any particular vehicle on any given day can cause a catastrophic loss. In the case of auto related injuries, striking a pedestrian child or bicyclist stands out as a huge liability claim. The deli might have minimum limits of liability on their policy. The distributor may have a $1 million limit and a hefty umbrella.

Transferring risk (purchasing insurance coverage) is the most cost-efficient and pragmatic approach to protecting your business assets and perpetuating your business. Small businesses are actually at a higher risk of being uninsured or underinsured in the event of a significant loss. Here are some reasons why:

**Limited internal resources**

Small business owners (SBOs) typically wear every hat in the company, including HR Director, risk manager and supervisor. My experience is that with only so many hours in each day, SBOs focus almost all of their energy on the income generating activities of their business. Whether it's behind a sales counter, on the phone, selling on the road, in the shop or in customer homes, SBOs typically devote little if any time to loss mitigation, risk transfer and insurance coverage review and administration.

**Insurance misconceptions**

SBOs are sensitive to expenses of every type. The lower the expense, the greater the net revenue. When every dollar of savings counts, and the insurance purchase is viewed as just another commodity, the lower the premium, the better. SBOs who focus on those hundreds of premium dollars saved over the years often miss the big picture. Risk transfer (insurance) is arguably MORE important to the SBO. A properly structured property and liability program can save, sustain and help perpetuate the business. If coverage is compromised with inadequate limits of insurance and coverage gaps, the SBO may save a few dollars in premium and have thousands or millions in uncovered losses.

**The less you have, the more you have to lose**

Businesses operating on a tight budget need continuous operations to survive. If the key machine is destroyed, or the delivery vehicle gets stolen, or a key employee resigns, the business is immediately in jeopardy. Uncovered, catastrophic losses bring small business to an abrupt end.

Small business owners may not be able to afford an in-house risk manager, but there are insurance professionals that can and will provide support.  If you commit to devoting time and attention to risk identification, there's a Coverage Assessment available to help protect and perpetuate your small business.
