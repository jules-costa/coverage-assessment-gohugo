Who do you want on your side?

Choosing your insurance representative is an important step. Your objective is to find a Trusted Advisor in the same manner you would engage an attorney or CPA. Your business depends on professional, timely and intelligent counsel.

If you are working through an internal Risk Manager or paid Consultant, broker ploys may be minimized, mostly because a third party is paying close attention. Even with an insurance consultant engaged, however, shenanigans can still take place, perhaps even orchestrated by the independent consultant.

Here are the first 3 Broker Ploys to be on the lookout for:

**Timing** - The CFO does not want to continually focus on insurance. It’s an expense that simply needs to be controlled and reduced. The ultimate importance and value of insurance is only evident at the time of claim. Brokers understand this mindset. As a result, expect “Concurrent Policies” as a strategy.

This is convenient for the broker and, in truth, for the client. It re-organizes all of the effective and expiration dates to a common date. While aiding the client administratively, this also locks in the broker to one focus date instead of multiple dates when the competition could infiltrate the relationship.

**Ex-Date** - Also known as the expiration date of the policy, ex-dates are gold nuggets gathered by prospecting brokers. By knowing the ex-date, brokers can time their approach to a prospect more confidently. The truth is that the ex-date is comparatively meaningless. Yes, it’s the policy anniversary when coverage must be renewed, but brokers organize their lives around the ex-date. Clients feel the love and attention more feverishly beginning 60-90 days prior to the ex-date. Brokers are traditionally absent the other 9-10 months.

**Last minute** - More timing issues. Clients consistently tell me they detest the “last-minute, no-notice, shove it down my throat, no options and force me to renew because I can’t afford a lapse in coverage and I have no time to look for options” approach. Yet, brokers know that a few delays and bumps in the road can be positioned and conveyed to the client to make the last-minute renewal seem justified. You might hear “My underwriter had questions, you didn’t get the updated information to me quickly enough, my assistant was on vacation…” For lazy brokers, this is the “close”. Last minute, no choices, I’m sorry about the stress, won’t happen again. And next renewal, same story. Eventually, and typically when a premium increase is part of the renewal, this strategy explodes and the client goes on a personal mission to replace the broker. But, brokers can buy a few years worth of renewals with this tactic.
