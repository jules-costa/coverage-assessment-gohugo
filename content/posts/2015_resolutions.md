title: 2015 Resolutions
+++

Are your 2015 resolutions a distant memory? New Year’s resolutions foster the temptation to find new ways of being more productive, healthier, improving relationships and quality of life advancement. For years, I succumbed to the temptation of making resolutions and experienced some slight, short-lived improvements. Those little accomplishments convinced me that the big “aha” moment was attainable.

*Just keep on searching.*

Taking my career to all-time heights has been a constant theme. How can I reach new levels of earnings, record numbers in new business and client retention, 100% employee loyalty and productivity? I was convinced 25 years ago that the insurance business was a unique career that offered the opportunity to accomplish so much. I still believe that’s true.

An insurance career is still one of the best kept career secrets for limitless financial earnings, constant learning, innovation, and most importantly, fulfilling promises to clients in their time of need. After 25 years, I still get personal satisfaction from speaking to clients and educating them on risk management decisions and insurance choices. I still get fulfillment from contributing to the success, growth and perpetuation of my commercial clients. I still feel the impact of helping a non-profit focus their energies on their mission by supporting their insurance programs.

Insurance brokers work hard for the money. Often earnings are commission-only based. It takes time, persistence and discipline to build and retain a profitable book of business. At 55, with a solid clientele, it takes even more discipline to continue balancing client service and retention with new client acquisition. Exceptional insurance brokers draw from their experiences, continue refining their interpersonal and organization skills, and never stop learning.

Here are three “aha” moments that have stared me in the face repeatedly and have made a huge long-term impact on my career:

**Walk, don’t run.**

Long-term growth and success at anything requires persistent and consistent action. Constant learning, attention to detail, clear, concise and thorough communications. You’re running if you skim through an insurance policy rather than read and understand all of its provisions. Reading a policy is a tedious process that the vast majority of insureds do not perform at all – until after the loss. The insurance policy is a contract and clients should expect and demand that insurance professionals earn their keep by understanding the provisions and explaining them. We always tell clients to Read the Policy.

For insurance brokers, walk, don’t run. No short cuts. Read, understand and explain the policy you are selling. You’re also running if your employee, underwriter and client communications are text-message style only. The only result from a quick-kill communication approach is surface level relationships.

For employees, don’t be shocked when they move on for better opportunities if you haven’t detailed their career path and set the example for the work ethic and productivity necessary to succeed.
For underwriters, don’t be resentful when you get turned down for that accommodation for a new client or premium relief on a renewal. If your submissions haven’t been complete and you haven’t developed the working rapport to earn the relationship, you don’t deserve the exception.

For clients, don’t be surprised when they non-renew if you haven’t provided value-added counsel, frequent, meaningful contact, and a trusted advisor relationship. If the only time the client hears from you is right before renewal, the insurance program has been commoditized and you have coverted the client to a price buyer. Don’t run to the next prospect until you have walked to the existing client’s office, asked the right questions, provided sound counsel, and showed them you are an important part of their business. When the client decides to leave you, don’t ask “what did I do wrong?” Consider what you didn’t do right enough.

**Walk the walk.**

It’s easy to be critical about someone else’s style, approach, appearance and decisions. Sharing criticisms about others with co-workers or family and friends fuels the process. Ultimately, we tend to spend more time focused on others than on ourselves. Who did what and how or to whom is easy to share and an interesting social dynamic. Reality TV like Survivor and the Bachelorette help us keep the attention focused on others. For those who wish to set the standard, lead by example and take risk: walk the walk.

If you find yourself spending more time and energy on self-improvement, productivity, personal and professional relationships and self-awareness, you are walking the walk and leaving the talk to others. Walking the walk also means setting the bar high for productivity, attention to detail, organization, and time management. Set the bar high, clearly communicate expectations of yourself and others, and align yourself with like-minded people who also walk the walk.
Walk with your head held high.

Do what you say you will do, when you say you will do it. No exceptions and no surprises. Amazingly, doing what’s right for clients and employees requires an annual 5-hour refresher in Business Ethics each year to maintain your Insurance license. In any profession, expect to stand out from the crowd and thrive long-term by simply conducting business and personal relationships professionally and ethically every time and all of the time – even when no one is looking.
