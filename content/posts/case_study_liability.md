title = "Case Study - Hired/Non-Owned Liability"
+++

We are so focused on the cost of auto insurance, a little endorsement tends to be overlooked. Here’s a coverage you MUST include on every Commercial Auto policy you place – Hired & Non-Owned Auto Liability.

A critical byproduct of the Coverage Assessment is identifying and correcting or accepting coverage gaps. While every potential claim scenario can never be evaluated, glaring coverage gaps are easily detected.

The gaps may occur within a particular policy through contract exclusions, limitations and definitions. The gaps may result from believing that coverage is afforded by one or more policies in the portfolio and learning that none of the policies adequately address the exposure. A simple example is Automobile Liability, more specifically, a bodily injury that results from an auto accident.

John Driver is an Outside Salesperson and operates his owned personal vehicle to visit client locations. John Driver is an employee of The Metal Store, Inc., and a metal goods wholesale distributor. Metal Store has a General Liability policy and Commercial Auto policy in force. The General Liability includes Premises Liability for their location and Products Liability. The Commercial auto policy has a fleet of 10 trucks schedules (listed or included). Neither policy includes a provision for “Hired/Non-Owned Auto liability”.

Hired auto liability extends bodily injury and property damage coverage to vehicles that are rented or leased in the conduct of business. Non-owned auto liability extends coverage to vehicles that are non-owned by the Named Insured but are used in the conduct of business.

John’s car qualifies under this section of coverage when his personally owned vehicle is being used to visit clients of The Metal Store.John hits a pedestrian in the parking lot of one of his clients. What insurance policy responds to the bodily injury claim? Primary coverage is under John’s Personal Auto policy.

A few concerns: what limit of coverage does John have? In New Jersey, statutory coverage is comparatively low at $15,000 per person/$30,000 per accident/$5,000 property damage. How does John’s insurance company think John uses the car? If the car is rated as “pleasure use” and John has been paying lower premiums based on this classification, there might be a coverage problem.

A little perspective: If you have a small fender bender and the total claim is comparatively insignificant, most carriers will just process it through and settle the claim. A severe claim? Not so fast. When an auto incident results in a significant bodily injury (BI) claim, a pedestrian death for extreme example, you can be sure that the insurance carrier will filter though the insurance contract, initial and renewal applications, and virtually every other piece of information and documentation relevant to the coverage, policy and claim.

Back to John’s accident. It’s a bad one. John operated the car while talking on a cell and this distraction contributed to the accident. The bodily injuries to the pedestrian mother and small child are significant and permanent. John’s personal auto carrier learns that John put 15,000 miles on his car last year and claims a tax deduction on his tax return as a business expense.

John uses his vehicle 80% of the time for business as a salesperson for The Metal Store. John’s personal insurance carrier denies covered based on a material misrepresentation at the time of application. John was paying a lower “pleasure use” premium for several years when he should have been paying a much higher premium based on the “business use” of his car. This is deemed an increased exposure. The Personal Auto policy result: no coverage.

The insurance company rescinds coverage back to inception, returns all premiums to John and walks away. A rescission is like the policy never existed. John has a personal umbrella for $1,000,000. Sorry. By definition the umbrella only kicks in after the underlying coverage limit is exhausted. No underlying coverage, no umbrella. Next stop on the claim, John’s client. The incident occurred in their parking lot and notice is given to the General Liability (Premises) carrier. The GL result: no coverage. Auto liability is specifically excluded. There may be an argument that the client’s parking lot was not maintained or in some way contributed to the accident, but it’s a long shot.

On to The Metal Store. John was there on business at The Metal Store’s direction. Based on this sample case – no coverage. Non-owned auto liability would have been the key coverage to respond to this claim. What now?

Desperate for coverage and fed up with insurance companies, John sues his Personal Insurance Broker. How dare they rescind coverage. John doesn’t understand insurance and admittedly told his broker “get me the lowest price”. The broker never asked about the car’s usage. The Metal Store CEO and CFO don’t understand insurance coverage, that’s why they engage a broker. They bought a Commercial Auto policy. John’s car was being used on a client business call. The broker never recommended or discussed Hired/Non-Owned auto liability. The Metal Store Inc sues the Commercial insurance broker for not offering the right coverage. Time to put your E&O carrier on notice.

Hired/Non-owned auto liability – always include it in your quotes and get a documented sign-off if the client for some ridiculous reason rejects the coverage.
