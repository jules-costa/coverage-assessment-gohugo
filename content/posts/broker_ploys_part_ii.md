title: Broker Ploys - Part II

**Blocking the Market**

Brokers will deny this ploy.

It’s real and it happens constantly. Carriers hate it. Brokers use “blocking the market” as a time-consuming and effective way to frustrate the competition and force the client into submission. Of all of the ploys, clients understand this one the very least.

Clients sometimes believe that by putting brokers in competition, the result will be the most favorable and profitable possible. Sometimes clients talk about comparable coverage and apples-to-apples. But we are not fooled. Most times, when a client places a broker in competition, it’s about price.

*“But, Mr. Client, I can’t do the best job for you if I can’t work with my carrier/underwriter/market. And my competitor has “blocked” the market.”*

What does the client say?

*“I want you to give me your best proposal. There are hundreds of insurance companies. Go find one that my current broker hasn’t approached.”

“But, Mr. Client, do you realize that the terms, conditions and pricing can be different from Carrier XYZ based on my submission versus my competitor’s?”*

The debate can go on forever. Bottom line: either decide the broker is right for your company for value-added reasons, or move on. If you allow the incumbent broker to block the market, there’s really no competition at all.

**The BOR game**

Naming the broker the Broker of Record effectively awards them your business. Many times, granting a BOR authorization is justified and the right move. When the client fairly compares broker capabilities, service expectations and results, and valued-added offerings, there might be solid justification to simply “BOR” the policies to another broker and give them the opportunity to perform to their promises. Especially if there is dissatisfaction or a loss confidence in the incumbent broker. This is the client’s right and prerogative.

But beware.

Too many times I have heard the client say “this other broker says he can save me money, give me a better deal, slash my costs, do great things and that the only way he can work on my account is with this letter I had to sign.” Shame on the broker for misleading the client and shame on the client being so naïve. (And if this were my client, shame on me for believing that he would never even consider another broker based on our relationship and the exceptional service I have delivered for so many years).

**“I have the juice”**

This one kills me. This is the ambulance chasing broker who is also lazy. Rather than taking the time to dig deep, identify and understand the client’s exposures, perform a complete coverage and risk assessment and propose a strategy to reduce the client’s Total Cost of Risk, what does this broker do?

*“Oh, your insurance is with Carrier XYZ? Our agency is the largest/most profitable broker for them. I know the President personally, and I just went to the Yankee game with the lead underwriter, yada yada yada. Give me a BOR and I’ll make a call for you. I have the juice that your current broker doesn’t.”*

Don’t believe it. Focus on coverage, and terms and rate, not on the supposed juice.
