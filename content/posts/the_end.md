title: The End
---

I often think about bringing the end to so many outdated and ludicrous things in our society. Someday my compilation of all things that must end will be complete and published. Toll plazas, NY City yellow cabs, the US postal service, casinos, even the brick and mortar office workplace. All of these and many more must end.

But for now, let’s bring the end to the Certificate of Insurance.

The Certificate of Insurance (cert) has plagued the insurance industry for decades. It’s not worth the paper it’s written on and says so at the top of the cert:

THIS CERTIFICATE IS ISSUED AS A MATTER OF INFORMATION ONLY AND CONFERS NO RIGHTS UPON THE CERTIFICATE HOLDER. THIS CERTIFICATE DOES NOT AFFIRMATIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AMEND, EXTEND OR ALTER THE COVERAGE AFFORDED BY THE POLICIES BELOW. THIS CERTIFICATE OF INSURANCE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE ISSUING INSURER(S), AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR PRODUCER, AND THE CERTIFICATE HOLDER. IMPORTANT: If the certificate holder is an ADDITIONAL INSURED, the policy(ies) must be endorsed. If SUBROGATION IS WAIVED, subject to the terms and conditions of the policy, certain policies may require an endorsement.

A statement on this certificate does not confer rights to the certificate holder in lieu of such endorsement(s). Originally intended to be a quick snapshot of commercial insurance coverage, the certificate of insurance (cert) has evolved into an unintended extension of coverage and the root cause of many an error and omissions claim in the insurance industry. Attorneys and risk mangers love certs, giving them more ammunition and targets in the event of a loss and claim. The target is the broker issuing the cert and the broker’s E&O carrier.

Insurance brokers and their strong associations have laid down and acquiesced to the demands of the customer.

__Big client or big client’s customer__: “Give me a cert! Include extra language like ‘additional insured’, ‘Waiver of Subrogation’, ‘primary and non-contributory’, and whatever else I want it to say!”

__Broker__: “You’re asking for so much, how about we just give you the policy?”

__Big client__: “No, no, no. I just want the cert and nothing else. Formatted exactly, to the punctuation mark, as my customer has specified. I need the cert to get paid/make deal, etc.”

What is going on here? The cert specifically states that it is NOT the policy and that the certificate holder should not rely on the information contained therein. Worthless, really. So why do brokers bend over backwards to issue them immediately, why do clients fire brokers if their cert performance falls short, and why does ACORD keep making money off of a document that has no positive value?

The end of the cert.

My position is simple: flip the switch today. No more certs. Period. If a party to a contract wants evidence of risk transfer (insurance) and additional insured status, get that endorsed onto the applicable policies. Waiver of Subrogation – same process. Anything else? Same process. The client’s attorney or risk manager isn’t sure about how an insurance policy would respond to a claim? Let them earn their keep. Give them a copy of the policy, with the client’s written permission, and let them read it. And when they come to the broker with hypotheticals, here’s the answer every time:

“The policy will respond based on the particular circumstances of the incident in relation to the provisions of the insurance contract”.

But what if????? Sorry, no hypotheticals. Lawyers and risk mangers are advised to read and understand the policy language, counsel their clients accordingly, and live with the consequences. The criticism insurance brokers will come under based on The End of the cert is what value do they bring to the table? Clients rely on a broker’s expertise in the interpretation of exposures and coverage, market prowess and counsel. Brokers seek the optimal policy terms, conditions and pricing to serve their clients well. In fact, insurance brokers, lawyers and risk managers are on the same side: looking out for the best interest of their client.

As a broker, I am committed to advocating for my client. Where I can transfer risk to another party contractually, that’s the right move. Where I can help my client waive or limit their Liability, I have served them well. After the claim, we’ll all find out how well my client and I and opposing counsel and the risk manager have done. Most cases are difficult to reconcile.

Let’s bring an end to the Certificate of insurance and get that meaningless piece of paper out of the way. Focus on the bottom line: the insurance contract. Sorry ACORD, but The End of the cert is near.
