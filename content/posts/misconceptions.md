Historically, the insurance industry has done a comparatively poor job in promoting the benefits and value of insurance policies and the professionals that broker coverage. Consumers understandably treat the insurance purchase with the same mindset and process as other more traditional expenses. Many consumers fall into the trap of viewing insurance from a biased perspective before the transaction begins.

Here are some reasons why:

**No return on investment** – consumers, especially those that have never experienced a significant claim, wonder why they pay and pay and pay insurance premiums and never get a return on their investments. Ironically, should an objective to paying high monthly health insurance premiums to get sick enough and rack up hospital, doctor and prescription bills? The fact is that insurance is an expense, not an investment.

Sometimes universal or whole life insurance may have the dual objective of investment and returns, but this type of policy is the exception. All other insurance policies are designed to transfer risk to the insurance carrier for a premium. Consumers will hopefully never need the carrier to step in because that means they had a loss.

**Price** – when you shop for most commodities, price comparison is natural. The best deal on a new car, lease, refrigerator, airline ticket, hotel…everything. We brag about how adeptly we found the best deal. Cheaper is better and to be celebrated. With all commodities, we make decisions on features and style and manufacturer. Perhaps we compromise and forego the alloy wheels, sunroof and heated seats. But the savings might be worth the compromise.

Insurance coverage is not a commodity. Decisions on insurance company, coverage limits, deductibles and “features” are still required, but the value of these compromises is not measurable until it’s too late – after the claim. Look for the best terms and conditions to address your exposures. Be honest about your risk tolerance (if a claim were to occur, what deductible could you handle?) and work with your broker to obtain the appropriate rate.

**All insurance is the same** – not so. Insurance carriers file policy forms in the States where they are authorized to do business. There are many industry standards (ISO), but each insurance policy can be and should be tailored to your particular exposures and insurance requirements. Insurance companies use limitations, exclusions and endorsements to customize the standard policy form.

**I’ll never have a claim.** - Insurance coverage provides a transfer of risk to an insurance company in the event of a “sudden and accidental” loss. While you can and should take steps to avoid a loss or mitigate a loss, we are all at risk. Accidents do happen despite our diligence. Underwriters review Loss History (typically for the past 5 years) as one consideration in rating coverage. Of course, a client with frequent losses is generally considered a higher risk. The frequency of claims points to potential shortcomings in loss prevention.

The best example of “I’ll never have a claim” is the invincible 20-25 year-old, in good health, exercising, feeling great, who does not need Health Insurance. As you assess your next policy, balance the cost of coverage against the benefits provided if you sustain a loss. You’ll see the value of the coverage in a different light.
