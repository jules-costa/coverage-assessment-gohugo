title: The Basics
+++

Many brokers have never experienced the opportunities and the challenges that a hard market presents. Temptations to take shortcuts and to take advantage of clients and carriers will become evident. How brokers respond to these temptations will not only differentiate them from the competition, but will also contribute to the longevity they have in the insurance industry.

This article is about making choices: long-term, strategic, ethical choices. Brokers will lose business to the opportunists that take shortcuts and take the middle or lower road. I encourage you to take the high road. Every transaction, every placement, every renewal, every proposal, every conversation. Every one. No exceptions. Books have been written about best practices in the insurance industry. Part of most State continuing education requirements now include 2 hours of Ethics. Doing the right thing, always, with clients as our sole focus, is easier said than done.

Here are 3 key principles that brokers can choose to follow:

**Transparency (aka the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth):**

As brokers compete for business, coverage and price are variables that determine who wins and who loses. Coverage must be detailed and must address the client’s exposures and expectations. “Comparable” coverage needs to be just that – equal to or better than. As professional brokers, we are responsible for negotiating the optimal terms and condition with carries, and clearly explaining the coverage and how it attends to the client’s exposures.

Take the time to walk through the proposal and explain the applicability of the coverage. Highlight the exclusions, limitations, deductibles and retentions. This explanation needs to be thorough at proposal and the client needs to sign off an acknowledgment. For their benefit and yours. Transparency regarding coverage at the onset eliminates issues at the time of claim. Cost transparency is equally important. Reveal to the client the results of your due diligence in the market. Summarize offers of coverage by line of insurance from each carrier approached. Explain declinations clearly. And, yes, reveal commissions. Brokers are entitled to compensation for the work in placing and administering the insurance program. If the client insists on a Fee Based structure, be fair to yourself. Assess the resources required to properly administer the client’s program and price your services accordingly. Competing brokers may underestimate the cost of service and underprice you. So be it.

Win business on price, lose it on price.

**Excel at the Basics:**

Insurance professionals offer a specialized knowledge in risk management and risk transfer. The objectives are to provide clients with comparatively intangible benefits: a sense of security, a safety net when accidents happen, asset protection, lifestyle protection, and perpetuation. The ultimate insurance deliverable is at the time of claim. How good the insurance product is can only be evaluated on claim performance: How much did I get? How fast and painless was the process? Without the claims process, clients have little tangible evidence of value.

It is therefore essential that brokers excel at the basics:

*Responsive* – every client inquiry needs very prompt response. Clients reach out with requests for coverage clarifications, changes in exposures, billing questions. When a client emails or calls the broker, the matter is important to them. Rapid responses demonstrate a sincere concern for the client. “If it’s important to you, it’s important to me.” Pretty basic.

*Relationship* – Communicating with clients solidifies the Trusted Advisor relationship. Connect with clients proactively throughout the year, not just at the 11th hour before renewal. Add value by providing the client with current information about their business, the insurance market, strategies to reduce risk, interesting claims examples. For larger clients, deliver Stewardship Reports mid-term. As with any relationship, work at staying connected. Very basic.

*Deliverables* – Clients get lots of information from insurance brokers. Proposals, binders, policies, ID cards, Certificates of Insurance, Schedules of Insurance, Statements of Value, invoices, endorsements and audits. Every deliverable reinforces the client perception of the broker, positive or negative. Deliverables that are always accurate, well-formatted, professionally constructed, and on time or early are the basic keys to client retention. Instill pride in the Agency personnel at every level to always deliver the highest quality to the client.

**Superior Work Product:**

The “customer service” measure has been diluted in most industries and clients have their own unique criteria to define “good service”.

When brokers establish a service model and processing standards, it’s a great start. (If your agency doesn’t have written service standards, stop reading this blog and start developing them. Meeting client service expectations cannot be measured or controlled without standards). The norms you establish may satisfy you, but may not meet the client’s expectations. If brokers try to squeeze clients into the agency service model, retention is jeopardized. When a client has specific service needs, or has been frustrated by the lack of “service” from the incumbent broker, this is an opportunity to earn and retain a long-term client.

Listen to the client. Not just the CEO/CFO/Controller, but to the client representatives that interact with Agency personnel. Where has service fallen short in the past? What’s most important to them? How can we work together to make the process smoother, better, more efficient, more productive, less stressful? When you gain this valuable information, customize the Agency service standards to properly address the client’s expectations. A healthy dialogue will leave you in partnership with the client.

Some clients may try to go overboard and dictate service expectations that cannot be realistically met. “I want every Certificate of Insurance issued in 5 minutes” is unrealistic. “We will commit to all Certificates of Insurance issued within 24 hours of request and can accommodate urgent requests within 1 hour” should be an acceptable, agreed upon standard that broker and client can live with. Once client expectations that define “good service” are established and agreed upon, brokers must work toward exceeding those expectations.

Surprise the client with outward signs that you are their trusted advisor, not just an insurance vendor. 2012 will present new challenges for brokers and clients. Some will ride the wave of change and make 2012 a strong 12 months of growth and retention. Your results will be in large part determined by how solid a foundation you operate from.

Transparency, excelling at the basics and providing a superior work product to clients will position you for a great 2012 and beyond.

Happy New Year.
