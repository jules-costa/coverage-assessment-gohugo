Hi, I'm Frank Costa.

I'm the author of Coverage Assessment and just completed my 24th year in the Insurance industry.

I founded my own local New Jersey agency from the basement of my home and grew the firm to over 4,000 clients in 12 years. I transitioned from Agency Principal to Senior VP and Sales Manager of a New York Regional agency. While continuing to serve and grow my clientele, I mentored and managed 8 insurance producers.

In 2009, I brought my experience and skill set to an International Brokerage based in New York City and led the Commercial Insurance Division responsible for over $50 million in annual client premiums. I am a Certified Insurance Counselor (CIC), experienced in interpreting insurance policy terms, conditions and provisions.

I attained my Certified Risk Manager (CRM) designation in 2008 and am qualified to perform Risk Assessments, Risk Analysis and Control Implementation for businesses of every size, scope and complexity.
